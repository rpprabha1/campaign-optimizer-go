# 📈 Next-Gen Multi-Platform Campaign Optimization Engine

## Objective

Design and implement a high-performance **Campaign Optimization Engine** that:

- Dynamically allocates ad campaigns across multiple platforms.
- Integrates real-time predictive analytics for bid optimization.
- Handles multi-threaded data processing with concurrency.
- Leverages distributed systems for scalability.
- Ensures fault tolerance and data consistency under high-load conditions.

## 🔧 Core Functional Requirements

### ✅ Real-Time Bidding & Predictive Analytics
- Simulates active campaigns with budgets, reach goals, and conversion targets.
- Feeds real-time CPC (Cost Per Click) and CVR (Conversion Rate) metrics.
- Lightweight predictive analytics (e.g., linear regression) forecasts short-term trends.

### 🧠 Decision Engine
- Determines:
  - **When to bid** (timing)
  - **Where to bid** (best platform)
  - **How much to bid** (ROI optimization)
- Balances:
  - Budget limits
  - Conversion maximization
  - Waste minimization (Pareto optimization)

### 🚀 Multi-Threaded & Distributed Architecture
- Each campaign's bid logic runs in a **separate Goroutine**.
- Scalable, distributed design with low-latency, real-time updates.
- Optional: Queueing via Kafka/NATS for microservices or node coordination.

### 📊 Real-Time Analytics & Monitoring
- Sliding window + linear regression for CPC/CVR prediction.
- Optional dashboard to monitor:
  - Campaign states
  - Live bidding decisions
  - System load and node health

## ⚙️ Concurrency & Distribution

- Goroutines handle each campaign independently.
- Mutexes and thread-safe maps ensure safe concurrent access.
- (Optional) Distributed nodes communicate via message queues.
- Eventual consistency models supported for high-load resilience.

---

## 📈 Predictive Analytics Module

- Sliding window stores historical CPC/CVR metrics per platform.
- Linear regression fits trend lines to forecast short-term fluctuations.
- Cached predictions reduce compute overhead during decision cycles.

---

## 🚦 Decision Engine Logic

- Computes **ROI** = (Predicted CVR × Conversion Value − CPC)
- Picks:
  - Highest ROI platform within budget
  - Optimal bid (based on predicted performance)
- Applies fallback strategy if all options are suboptimal

---

## 🔄 Scheduler

- Periodically triggers bidding logic (e.g., every 2s)
- Evaluates each campaign in parallel
- Logs decisions with timestamp and performance metrics

---

## 🛡️ Fault Tolerance & Scalability

- Safe concurrent data access using Go's primitives
- Graceful degradation using fallback strategies and error logging
- Horizontally scalable via microservices or worker queues
- Benchmarking tools to simulate high-load scenarios

---

## 📊 Dashboard & Monitoring (Optional)

- Live display of:
  - Campaigns and bids
  - ROI trends
  - Node load
  - System health
- Metrics can be exported to Prometheus/Grafana or a web UI

---

## 🧪 Testing & Benchmarks

- Unit tests for all major modules
- Benchmark tests to simulate 1000s of concurrent campaigns
- Latency, throughput, and memory metrics included

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```

Customize bid intervals, platform metrics, and campaign data in respective modules.
